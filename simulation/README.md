** Debug package not found:

-Does the file actually exists? Yes, the file is in the launch folder.

-Did you source the setup.bash file? Do you mean source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash ? Yes, I did.

-What does rospack find tb_tables output? [rospack] Error: stack/package tb_tables not found

After using source /home/gabriel/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash I can find it with rospack find.
